# Assignment 8

# Problem 1 (Traffic light):  

Two players drive up to the same intersection at the same time. If both attempt to cross, the result is a fatal traffic accident. The game can be modeled by a payoff matrix where crossing successfully has a payoff of 1, not crossing pays 0, while an accident costs −100.  

- Build the payoff matrix  
- Find the Nash equilibria  
- Find a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium  
- - Compute the expected payoff for one player (the game is symmetric)  

## Problem 2 kicking penalty:  

Kicking a penalty, if the kicker sends the ball one side and the goalkeeper goes on the same side, the latter will always be able to catch the ball and avoid the goal. A certain kicker never fails when kicks left, instead he sometimes fails (say once every four penalties) when kicks right. Should him prefer kicking left? Model this situation as a game, describe a strategy both for the kicker and the goalkeeper and compute the expected payoff for both players. 

## Problem 3 (hawk–dove): 

Two cars stand on the opposite sides of a long bridge (as long as they cannot see the other side) that is narrow enough that only one car can cross it. If both attempt to cross the bridge, they will meet in the middle and remain stuck for several hours until the tow truck rescues them. As an alternative, each driver may decide to follow a secondary road, which is much wider but also much longer.  Model this situation as a game, find the Nash equilibrium and discuss a possible mixed strategy. 

## Problem 4:    

The Municipality of your city wants to implement an algorithm for the assignment of children to kindergartens that, on the one hand, takes into account the desiderata of families and, on the other hand, reduces city traffic caused by taking children to school. Every school has a maximum capacity limit that cannot be exceeded under any circumstances. As a form of welfare, the Municipality has established the following two rules:   

- in case of a child already attending a certain school, the sibling is granted the same school;  
- families with only one parent have priority for schools close to the workplace.   

Model the situation as a stable matching problem and describe the payoff functions of the players. Question: what happens to twin siblings?
