# Assignment 1

## Exercise 1
Describe and analyze how to transform the randomized Karp-Rabin string search algorithm from Montecarlo to Las Vegas

## Exercise 2
Show that h_{ab}(x) = (a x + b % p) % m is 2-independent

## Exercise 3
Consider the deletion in cuckoo hashing: build an example so that the deletion does not produce a feasible graph, meaning that there is no insertion-only sequence that can lead to that graph. Show how to fix this by randomly choosing among h_1 and h_2 when inserting.
