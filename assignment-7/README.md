# Assignment 7

## Problem 1: Variant of Stag Hunt  

Consider the following variant of n-hunter Stag Hunt:  
- only n hunters, with 2 ≤ m ≤ n, need to pursue the stag in order to catch it
- there is still a single stag 
- stag is shared only by the hunters that catch it 
- that each hunter prefers the fraction 1/m of the stag to a hare. 

Find the Nash equilibria using the best response. Tip: try to show a case say with n=4. 

## Problem 2: Dividing money  

Two people use the following algorithm to divide $10 between themselves. Each person names an integer number in the range [0, 10].  

- If the sum of the numbers is at most 10 then each person receives the amount of money she names and the remainder is destroyed.  
- Otherwise (the sum of the numbers exceeds 10) 
- - if the amounts named are different then the person who named the smaller amount receives that amount and the other person receives the remaining money. 
- - If the amounts named are the same then each person receives $5. 

Find the Nash equilibria using the best response function. Tip: try to make a graphical representation of the problem. 

## Problem 3 

An investment agency wants to collect a certain amount of money for a project. Aimed at convincing all the members of a group of N people to contribute to the fund, it proposes the following contract: each member can freely decide either to contribute with 100 euros or not to contribute (retaining money on its own wallet). Independently on this choice, after one year, the fund will be rewarded with an interest of 50% and uniformly redistributed among all the N members of the group. Describe the game and find the Nash equilibrium.  

## Problem 4 

After Diabolik's capture, inspector Ginko is forced to free him because the judge, scared of Eva Kant's revenge, has acquitted him with an excuse. Outraged by the incident, the mayor of Clerville decides to introduce a new legislation to make judges personally liable for their mistakes. The new legislation allows the accused to sue the judge and have him punished in case of error. Consulted on the subject, Ginko is perplexed and decides to ask you to provide him with a formal demonstration of the correctness/incorrectness of this law.
